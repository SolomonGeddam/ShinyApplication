```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Overview

This is the Shiny code for the Data Products Coursera course taught by John Hopkins University.


## Synopsis
This is the user-interface definition of a Shiny web application that illustrates the effect of noise on a signal.

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Procedure
The objective is to fit the following expression with a linear model:
yi=xi+??ifor i=1,.,n
where ??i=N(??,??) for i=1,.,n.

We provide the user with three sliders:

the number of points n (our measurements);
the mean of the Gaussian random noise, ??;
the standard deviation of the Gaussian random noise, ??.
The linear model is illustrated via a plot and the R2 value is provided as a measure of the quality of the fit.
